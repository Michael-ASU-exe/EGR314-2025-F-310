According to the National Park Service, 85% of wildfires are human-caused. Because of this, our device will focus on human-made fire prevention. While some forest fires are completely out of our control, such as ones caused by lightning strikes, there is no reason why we shouldn\u2019t be able to establish preventative measures for ourselves.</p> <p>With our product, we wish to accomplish this basic task of fire prevention while also improving the issues with products currently on the market, such as battery life, physical durability, etc. Our audience in this context will be local fire departments/agencies, first responders, and larger national drone companies. Fire departments and first responders will likely be interested in using our product to help make their lives easier, and drone companies may want to invest in our product if it proves to be both reliable and financially viable.</p> Brainstorming Ideas The first image is our brainstorming board. The \"Design Ideas\" are color-coded tiles that indicate which teammate contributed each idea. It features a variety of themes, including ideas on drone rescue, radar, and UAVs, like \u201cdrones that map evacuation paths\u201d and \u201cwind detection for further prevention.\u201d The board highlights individual creativity while fostering collaboration to refine ideas.  The next image is our brainstormed ideas ranked across four tiers from S tier to C tier. We have decided that having thermal cameras, 360-degree LiDAR sensors, thermal imaging satellites or towers, and solar-powered heat-seeking stations is a good base to build off of for our future prototype.  The team also contemplated using a range of sensors, from heat sensors to humidity sensors to light sensors etc. to aide our drones/robot in reading and sending alerts  Since we came up with a myriad of ideas to fall back on, the team is pretty confident that we have a solid direction on how we\u2019re going to develop our prototype.     <p> </p> Heat Seekers project video <p> </p> Design Concept Sketch We designed our device to be small, compact, and discreet so it blends naturally into the environment. A servo motor allows the camera to rotate, enabling wide-area monitoring without the need for multiple units. To ensure reliable long-range communication, we integrated an antenna for both sending and receiving signals. In addition, we equipped the system with a thermal camera to detect potential hot spots, such as those caused by campfires. An atmospheric pressure sensor helps predict incoming lightning storms, while a humidity sensor tracks moisture levels in the air\u2014both critical for assessing fire risk.   <p> </p>"},{"location":"Schematic/","title":"Schematic","text":""},{"location":"Schematic/#schematic","title":"Schematic","text":"<p>   Open full-size PDF in new tab </p>"},{"location":"Team%20Block%20Diagram/","title":"Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"Appendix/","title":"Appendix","text":""},{"location":"Appendix/#team-goals","title":"Team Goals","text":"<ul> <li>Early detection &amp; prevention<ul> <li>Provide campground employees with real-time alerts of thermal anomalies to address potential fire hazards before ignition.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Human-Centered Design</p> <ul> <li>Embrace the \u201chuman element\u201d by ensuring that the system supports staff decision-making rather than replacing it.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Scalability &amp; Adaptability</p> <ul> <li>Create a modular tower system that can be deployed at multiple campsites, with hardware and software that adapt to different terrains and conditions.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Technical Innovation</p> <ul> <li>Integrate ESP32-based communications, a motorized IR sensor array, and thermal cameras into a robust, 10 ft tower design that is reliable in harsh outdoor environments.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Stakeholder Impact</p> <ul> <li> <p>Deliver value to multiple stakeholders:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Campground Staff: actionable data to keep campers safe.</p> </li> <li> <p>Campers/Communities: improved safety and peace of mind.</p> </li> <li> <p>Environmental Agencies: a proactive, low-impact solution for wildfire prevention.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"Appendix/#team-communication","title":"Team Communication","text":"Name First Second Third Michael Cockerham Text Discord Email Kaden Johnson Text Discord Email Cory Lewis Text Discord Email Zachary Stradling Text Discord Email Rishik Atluri Discord Text Email"},{"location":"Appendix/#communication-procedures","title":"Communication Procedures","text":"<p>We will communicate throughout the week via text or discord and will hold weekly meetings to update ourselves on where we all are on the parts we are working on.

Compared to the Raspberry Pi Pico and Arduino Uno R3, it delivers significantly higher processing power and more versatile peripherals, making it better suited for our project\u2019s performance and connectivity requirements. Its balance of cost, features, and low-power capabilities makes it the most efficient choice amongst the three.        Power Regulator Selection Component Image Advantages Disadvantages Link LM2575D2T-3.3R4G          - Highly efficient, so less heat dissipation.         - Wide input voltage range, ideal when powered from 12V - 40V sources.         - 1A output current, which is suitable for powering microcontrollers, sensors, and small motors.         - Integrated switch, protection, and simple external parts. Needs only a diode, inductor, and two capacitors.                  - More output ripple noise when compared to linear regulators.         - Switching EMI noise so how we design the layout on the PCB and decoupling are critical.         - Slightly more complex design.         LF33ABDT-TR          - Higher current capability than the L4931.         - Low dropout and low noise performance similiar to L4931.         - Good line and load regulation.         - Stable with just one 2.2 uF capacitor.                 - Its Linear topology makes it inefficient for high input/output differences.          - Will run hot under high current or a large voltage drop.        L4931          - With a .4V dropout voltage, we can regulate with the small headroom.         - Simple design with just one 2.2uF capacitor for stability.         - Low noise output.                 - Efficiency is low for large voltage drops.         - Limited current which is not suitable for heavier loads.         - Power dissipation can get high.        Our selection Component Image Justification LM2575D2T-3.3R4G          Our Choice: LM2575D2T-3.3R4G \u2013 Our team decided to go with the LM2575T because efficiency, current capacity and it has the highest input voltage range of the three. The LM2575T is slightly more expensive and requires a few additional external components, but performance and lower long-term power cost make it the most cost-effective and reliabe choice for our design.        Sensor Selection Component Image Advantages Disadvantages Link HPP845E031R4          - Fully calibrated &amp; linearized digital ouput which means we can expect an easy integration vis I2C with no extra calibration needed.         - Extremely low current consumption which is suitable for our low-power IoT applications.         - Safe for long term production                 - Going to need some extra tools to solder onto board.         - Limited documentation on how to compnesate for the self-heating.         - Fewer software libraries than the SHT21        SHT21-TR          - Excellent Accuracy. The sensor reads within +/- 2% of the true relative humidity value.         - Low power consumption.         - Well-documented interface and timing. Widely supported in linraries for arduino, ESP32, and STM32.                 - Slightly higher cost than the HPP845E031R4.         - Higher active current draw compared to the HPP845E031R4.         - Not as physically rugged. Recommends a protective filter membrane for harsh environments.        SHT30-DIS-B2.5KS          - The 30 series for humidity sensors by Sensirion are genreally better in accuracy and comes with a tighter tolerance.         - Broader supply voltage can give more flexibility with system voltage rails.         - Although more expensive, the SHT30 can come with a metal case, making more rugged and reliable for outdoor use.                 - More complex features require careful implementaion         - Could be seen as overkill for what we are trying to accomplish.         - Small footprint package can make handling and soldering a bit more challenging.        Our selection Component Image Justification HPP845E031R4          Our Choice: HPP845E031R4 \u2013 We decided to move forward with the HPP845E031R4 because of its balance in performance, simplicity and cost. Like the SHT21, it provides accurate relative humidity and temperature readings, full digital I2C output, and a wide operating range of -40 degrees celsius to 125 degrees celsius. With a current consumption around .014mA, we are able to minimize power draw, which is valuable for embedded systems. While the newer SHT3x sensors can overachieve in all those categories, it comes with a notably higher price. The HPP845E031R4 will deliver the accuracy and reliability we need for our embedded system without overcomplicating the system or inflating project cost.        Motor Driver Selection Component Image Advantages Disadvantages Link DRV8825PWPR          - Wide voltage range of 8.2V - 45V.         - Compatible with many motor types and supply systems.         - High output current for reliable torque delivery.         - Simple STEP/DIR interface makes it easy to control from microcontrollers like the ESP32.         - Well-documented and widely supported in the maker and robotics communites.                 - Requires external sense resistors and tuning for current control         - Limited to 1/32 microstepping which is less precise than the L6470H.         - Needs proper PCB heat dissipation for high current loads.        L6470H          - Advanced motion control engine         - Manages acceleration, deceleration, speed, and position autonomously via SPI commands.         - High microstepping resolution(1/128) will enable a smoother and quiter motor operation.         - Sensorless stall detection for position awareness.          - Complex setup.         - Higher cost and component count than basic drivers.         - Not suited for quick prototyping.         - Slightly higher quiescent current draw than DRV8825.        Fan8100N          - Dual-channel H-bridge can drive two DC motors or one motor in parallel up to 3A.         - Low-voltage operation, which makes it ideal for battery-powered systems.         - Simple Forward/Reverse/Brake control logic.         - With its low saturation voltage, it is guaranteed to be efficient at low voltages.                 - Designed for DC motors, not stepper motors.         - Limited voltage range with a max of 9V.         - Lower power handling than the DRV8825 or L6470H        Our selection Component Image Justification DRV8825PWPR          Our Choice: DRV8825PWPR \u2013  Our team decided that the DRV8825 is the ideal motor driver for our project. It provides a balance of cost, simplicity, and performance. It supports up to 2.5 A per phase with microstepping up to 1/32, providing smooth and precise motion control without complex configuration. Its STEP/DIR interface integrates easily with the ESP32, which can minimize programming and wiring effort. At a typical cost around $5-$8, it delivers strong reliability and efficiency at a fraction of the price.        Motor Selection Component Image Advantages Disadvantages Link 324          - High torque density for its size.         - 4 x stronger than the MOT-I-81619.         - 1.8 degree step angle.         - Excellent thermal and mechanical stability                 - Slightly heavier         - Requires a driver with proper current control         - Higher cost than basic geared toy-grade steppers, but still mid-range overall.         MOT-I-81619          - Standard NEMA-17 which makes it compatible with most mounts.         - Moderate torque which makes it suitable for light mechanical systems         - Low current draw of .33A         - Simple 2-phase bipolar wiring                 - Lower torque output than our 324 model         - Inductance may limit speed response and acceleration. 918          - Very compact and lightweight.         - Ideal for small beginners and small projects.         - Works easily with Arduino Motor Shields or other low-voltage drivers.                   - Very low torque.         - slow speed.         - Geared design reduces efficiency and introduces backlash in precision applications.        Our selection Component Image Justification 324          Our Choice: 324 \u2013  Our group will go with the 324 motor or better known as the 42mm hybrid high torque stepper motor because of the combination of torque, precision and compatibility for our project. With the 1.8 degree steps, it ensures precise motion control, while its 1.6 kg\u00b7cm holding torque delivers sufficient strength for mechanical loads without excessive current draw. Its ability to pair with the DRV8825 motor driver provides us with a simple guide on the wiring and reliability when it comes to perfomance at the 12V. Though slightly more expensive than a smaller hobby stepper motor, its superior torque output and robust construction make it the most cost-effective and capable option for consistent, high-accuracy operation in our system."},{"location":"component-selection-example/#bill-of-materials","title":"Bill Of Materials","text":"<p>   Open full-size PDF in new tab </p>"},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/","title":"MathJax","text":""},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#mathjax","title":"MathJax","text":""},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#beautiful-math-in-all-browsers","title":"Beautiful math in all browsers","text":"<p>MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers.
