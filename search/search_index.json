According to the National Park Service, 85% of wildfires are human-caused. Because of this, our device will focus on human-made fire prevention. While some forest fires are completely out of our control, such as ones caused by lightning strikes, there is no reason why we shouldn\u2019t be able to establish preventative measures for ourselves.</p> <p>With our product, we wish to accomplish this basic task of fire prevention while also improving the issues with products currently on the market, such as battery life, physical durability, etc. Our audience in this context will be local fire departments/agencies, first responders, and larger national drone companies. Fire departments and first responders will likely be interested in using our product to help make their lives easier, and drone companies may want to invest in our product if it proves to be both reliable and financially viable.</p> Brainstorming Ideas The first image is our brainstorming board. The \"Design Ideas\" are color-coded tiles that indicate which teammate contributed each idea. It features a variety of themes, including ideas on drone rescue, radar, and UAVs, like \u201cdrones that map evacuation paths\u201d and \u201cwind detection for further prevention.\u201d The board highlights individual creativity while fostering collaboration to refine ideas.  The next image is our brainstormed ideas ranked across four tiers from S tier to C tier. We have decided that having thermal cameras, 360-degree LiDAR sensors, thermal imaging satellites or towers, and solar-powered heat-seeking stations is a good base to build off of for our future prototype.  The team also contemplated using a range of sensors, from heat sensors to humidity sensors to light sensors etc. to aide our drones/robot in reading and sending alerts  Since we came up with a myriad of ideas to fall back on, the team is pretty confident that we have a solid direction on how we\u2019re going to develop our prototype.     <p> </p> Heat Seekers project video <p> </p> Design Concept Sketch We designed our device to be small, compact, and discreet so it blends naturally into the environment. A servo motor allows the camera to rotate, enabling wide-area monitoring without the need for multiple units. To ensure reliable long-range communication, we integrated an antenna for both sending and receiving signals. In addition, we equipped the system with a thermal camera to detect potential hot spots, such as those caused by campfires. An atmospheric pressure sensor helps predict incoming lightning storms, while a humidity sensor tracks moisture levels in the air\u2014both critical for assessing fire risk.   <p> </p>"},{"location":"Team%20Block%20Diagram/","title":"Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"esp-32-table/","title":"ESP32 Table","text":"ESP Info Answer Help Model ?
