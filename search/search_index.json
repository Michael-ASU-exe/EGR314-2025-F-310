According to the National Park Service, 85% of wildfires are human-caused. Because of this, our device will focus on human-made fire prevention. While some forest fires are completely out of our control, such as ones caused by lightning strikes, there is no reason why we shouldn\u2019t be able to establish preventative measures for ourselves.</p> <p>With our product, we wish to accomplish this basic task of fire prevention while also improving the issues with products currently on the market, such as battery life, physical durability, etc. Our audience in this context will be local fire departments/agencies, first responders, and larger national drone companies. Fire departments and first responders will likely be interested in using our product to help make their lives easier, and drone companies may want to invest in our product if it proves to be both reliable and financially viable.</p> Brainstorming Ideas The first image is our brainstorming board. The \"Design Ideas\" are color-coded tiles that indicate which teammate contributed each idea. It features a variety of themes, including ideas on drone rescue, radar, and UAVs, like \u201cdrones that map evacuation paths\u201d and \u201cwind detection for further prevention.\u201d The board highlights individual creativity while fostering collaboration to refine ideas.  The next image is our brainstormed ideas ranked across four tiers from S tier to C tier. We have decided that having thermal cameras, 360-degree LiDAR sensors, thermal imaging satellites or towers, and solar-powered heat-seeking stations is a good base to build off of for our future prototype.  The team also contemplated using a range of sensors, from heat sensors to humidity sensors to light sensors etc. to aide our drones/robot in reading and sending alerts  Since we came up with a myriad of ideas to fall back on, the team is pretty confident that we have a solid direction on how we\u2019re going to develop our prototype.     <p> </p> Heat Seekers project video <p> </p> Design Concept Sketch We designed our device to be small, compact, and discreet so it blends naturally into the environment. A servo motor allows the camera to rotate, enabling wide-area monitoring without the need for multiple units. To ensure reliable long-range communication, we integrated an antenna for both sending and receiving signals. In addition, we equipped the system with a thermal camera to detect potential hot spots, such as those caused by campfires. An atmospheric pressure sensor helps predict incoming lightning storms, while a humidity sensor tracks moisture levels in the air\u2014both critical for assessing fire risk.   <p> </p>"},{"location":"Schematic/","title":"Schematic","text":""},{"location":"Schematic/#schematic","title":"Schematic","text":"<p>   Open full-size PDF in new tab </p>"},{"location":"Team%20Block%20Diagram/","title":"Block Diagram","text":"<p>Since the team's initial conception of our block diagram, we have made changes to the wireless communication aspect, transitioning from MQTT to the ESP-NOW protocol between the microcontroller and the humidity sensor and the thermal imaging camera.</p> <p>The team had structured the block diagram in such a way that each individual member had their own subsystem to work on and be responsible for. The block diagram that you see above consists of the designated microcontroller, a buck regulator to step down voltage to the required 3.3V threshold, a thermal camera and a sensor system both running on I2C protocol and a motor driver to add mechanical movement to our device. Our diagram meets the main requirements of having a wireless communication protocol, a serial advanced communication protocol, having atleast one sensor and a motor subsystem and having a fixed power supply.</p> <p></p> <p>The sequence diagram above demonstrates how the overall system behavior achieves the intended functionality of collecting environmental data and reacting through controlled motor movement. The user needs a system that continuously monitors humidity and temperature conditions while adjusting motor positioning in response to changing environmental conditions. The sequence diagram satisfies these needs by showing the ESP32 initiating all communication and retrieving data from both the humidity sensor and the thermal camera using their appropriate digital interfaces. The return messages from the sensors ensure that the ESP32 receives complete and up-to-date environmental information. The diagram then shows the ESP32 interpreting this data and issuing motor control signals to the motor driver. This flow ensures that sensor readings directly influence mechanical output, meeting the requirement for responsive actuation. Furthermore, the sequential order makes the timing and dependencies clear: power must be applied, interfaces must initialize, sensor data must be collected, and processing must occur before any motor movement. This strict operational sequence ensures safe, predictable, and requirement-compliant system behavior.</p>"},{"location":"Team%20Block%20Diagram/#decision-making-process","title":"Decision Making Process","text":"<p>The team designed the message structure around clarity, modularity, and protocol consistency. Because the ESP32 serves as the controller, the team agreed that it should always initiate communication with each subsystem. This eliminated unnecessary complexity and ensured that all messages followed a predictable request-and-response pattern. For the sensors, the team followed the manufacturer communication standards\u2014using I\u00b2C for the humidity sensor and digital communication for the thermal camera. This ensured compatibility and minimized software overhead. Each message contains a clear purpose: the ESP32 sends a command, the device returns data, and the ESP32 acknowledges or uses that data immediately. For the motor driver, the message structure was intentionally kept simple, consisting of step and direction control signals rather than complex data packets. This decision increases reliability and aligns with standard stepper motor driver interfaces. Through this structured approach, the team ensured that message handling remained deterministic, easy to debug, and fully aligned with the functional requirements of synchronized sensing and actuation.</p>"},{"location":"Team%20Block%20Diagram/#top-5-biggest-changes-to-our-software-design-since-initial-proposal","title":"Top 5 Biggest Changes To Our Software Design Since Initial Proposal","text":""},{"location":"Team%20Block%20Diagram/#1-migration-of-the-thermal-camera-subsystem-from-micropython-to-circuitpython","title":"1. Migration of the Thermal Camera Subsystem from MicroPython to CircuitPython","text":"<p>Originally, the team planned to program all subsystems\u2014including the thermal imaging camera\u2014using MicroPython for consistency and simplified integration. However, during implementation, the team discovered that no functional or stable MicroPython library existed for the selected thermal camera module. After extensive testing and library searches, the team determined that CircuitPython was the only platform providing a reliable, well-supported driver. This required rewriting the thermal camera codebase, adapting communication routines, and restructuring the ESP32 interface to handle data processed externally through CircuitPython. This change represented the most significant deviation from the initial proposal, as it required modifying the software architecture and planning for interpreter-specific behavior.</p>"},{"location":"Team%20Block%20Diagram/#2-clear-separation-of-sensor-request-and-response-handling","title":"2. Clear Separation of Sensor Request and Response Handling","text":"<p>Originally, the software proposal grouped sensor reads together in a single function call. As the design evolved, the team realized that each sensor needed dedicated request-and-response steps for reliability and timing control.

Removal of Unnecessary Power-Up Dependencies","text":"<p>The original software design attempted to sequence subsystem startup artificially. After refining the hardware understanding, the team simplified the logic so that only the ESP32 requires an explicit software initialization stage, while the sensors naturally become ready as soon as they receive regulated voltage.

Compared to the Raspberry Pi Pico and Arduino Uno R3, it delivers significantly higher processing power and more versatile peripherals, making it better suited for our project\u2019s performance and connectivity requirements. Its balance of cost, features, and low-power capabilities makes it the most efficient choice amongst the three.        Power Regulator Selection Component Image Advantages Disadvantages Link LM2575D2T-3.3R4G          - Highly efficient, so less heat dissipation.         - Wide input voltage range, ideal when powered from 12V - 40V sources.         - 1A output current, which is suitable for powering microcontrollers, sensors, and small motors.         - Integrated switch, protection, and simple external parts. Needs only a diode, inductor, and two capacitors.                  - More output ripple noise when compared to linear regulators.         - Switching EMI noise so how we design the layout on the PCB and decoupling are critical.         - Slightly more complex design.         LF33ABDT-TR          - Higher current capability than the L4931.         - Low dropout and low noise performance similiar to L4931.         - Good line and load regulation.         - Stable with just one 2.2 uF capacitor.                 - Its Linear topology makes it inefficient for high input/output differences.          - Will run hot under high current or a large voltage drop.        L4931          - With a .4V dropout voltage, we can regulate with the small headroom.         - Simple design with just one 2.2uF capacitor for stability.         - Low noise output.                 - Efficiency is low for large voltage drops.         - Limited current which is not suitable for heavier loads.         - Power dissipation can get high.        Our selection Component Image Justification LM2575D2T-3.3R4G          Our Choice: LM2575D2T-3.3R4G \u2013 Our team decided to go with the LM2575T because efficiency, current capacity and it has the highest input voltage range of the three. The LM2575T is slightly more expensive and requires a few additional external components, but performance and lower long-term power cost make it the most cost-effective and reliabe choice for our design.        Sensor Selection Component Image Advantages Disadvantages Link HPP845E031R4          - Fully calibrated &amp; linearized digital ouput which means we can expect an easy integration vis I2C with no extra calibration needed.         - Extremely low current consumption which is suitable for our low-power IoT applications.         - Safe for long term production                 - Going to need some extra tools to solder onto board.         - Limited documentation on how to compnesate for the self-heating.         - Fewer software libraries than the SHT21        SHT21-TR          - Excellent Accuracy.

Our selection Component Image Justification HPP845E031R4          Our Choice: HPP845E031R4 \u2013 We decided to move forward with the HPP845E031R4 because of its balance in performance, simplicity and cost. Like the SHT21, it provides accurate relative humidity and temperature readings, full digital I2C output, and a wide operating range of -40 degrees celsius to 125 degrees celsius. With a current consumption around .014mA, we are able to minimize power draw, which is valuable for embedded systems. While the newer SHT3x sensors can overachieve in all those categories, it comes with a notably higher price. The HPP845E031R4 will deliver the accuracy and reliability we need for our embedded system without overcomplicating the system or inflating project cost.

Our selection Component Image Justification 324          Our Choice: 324 \u2013  Our group will go with the 324 motor or better known as the 42mm hybrid high torque stepper motor because of the combination of torque, precision and compatibility for our project. With the 1.8 degree steps, it ensures precise motion control, while its 1.6 kg\u00b7cm holding torque delivers sufficient strength for mechanical loads without excessive current draw. Its ability to pair with the DRV8825 motor driver provides us with a simple guide on the wiring and reliability when it comes to perfomance at the 12V. Though slightly more expensive than a smaller hobby stepper motor, its superior torque output and robust construction make it the most cost-effective and capable option for consistent, high-accuracy operation in our system.
