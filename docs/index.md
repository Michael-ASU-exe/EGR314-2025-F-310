# Our Mission Statement
Our mission is to create a device that utilizes infrared technology to detect hot spots from abandoned campfires and alert the forest service, thereby helping to prevent wildfires from spreading.
## Team Charter
As a team, we are committed to designing and building a wildfire prevention device within 16 weeks and a budget of $300, utilizing the skills and techniques we will learn from EGR 314.
