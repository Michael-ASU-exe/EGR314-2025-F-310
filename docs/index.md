# Our Mission Statement
    Our mission is to design and prototype innovative embedded systems that enhance wildfire prevention, detection, and response. By integrating advanced sensing, microcontroller, and IoT technologies into UAV platforms and ground-based weather stations, we aim to deliver reliable, real-time data that empowers firefighting agencies, protects local communities, and supports environmental stewardship. Through scalable, resilient, and stakeholder-focused solutions, our team is committed to shifting wildfire management from reactive firefighting to proactive risk prevention.

## Team Charter

* Sell 10 units in our first year.
    * Focusing in on the Tonto National forest we believe we can convinve ten campgrounds to invest in our product in the first year. 
* Take four months to go from opportunity identification to shipping our first units.
    * One base unit is a 10 ft tower with thermal and IR sensors, a motor for scanning 360°, and an ESP32 + server network.
* Reliable 360° sensor coverage with minimal false positives.
    * With a budget of $300, Acheiving this will be pivotal in our success. 
* Real-time communication to a local server accessible by campground employees.
    * Will be a great selling point for our product in todays world. 
* A functional prototype demonstrating fire hazard detection at a test site.
    * Getting a prototype running will make selling 10 units, that much easier. 

## Team Goals

* Early detection & prevention
    - Provide campground employees with real-time alerts of thermal anomalies to address potential fire hazards before ignition.
* Human-Centered Design
    - Embrace the “human element” by ensuring that the system supports staff decision-making rather than replacing it.

* Scalability & Adaptability
    - Create a modular tower system that can be deployed at multiple campsites, with hardware and software that adapt to different terrains and conditions.

* Technical Innovation

    - Integrate ESP32-based communications, a motorized IR sensor array, and thermal cameras into a robust, 10 ft tower design that is reliable in harsh outdoor environments.

* Stakeholder Impact

    - Deliver value to multiple stakeholders:

        * Campground Staff: actionable data to keep campers safe.

        * Campers/Communities: improved safety and peace of mind.

        * Environmental Agencies: a proactive, low-impact solution for wildfire prevention.

### Communication Procedures

this is how we do it talk about, when (need 4 hours), who starts, how we keep track, other stuff

## Team Roles

## Team Coordination & Accountability

* Ensure that assignments are submitted before deadlines and each team member has "signed off" on each submitted assignment
* Ensure that each team member has the knowledge and skill required for each assignment, and if that is not the case, we will adapt.
* Ensure that feedback from your design review is distributed to and acted on by every member of the team.
* When it comes to contributions missed on assignments, we will expect some type of explanation from that team member and ask for some responsibility on their end on how to rectify the situation.
* We will not force team members into assignments but we do assume that each member will volunteer when needed. 
* We expect team members to ask for help if they have run into work that they can't seem to accomplish.
* If a team member refuses to ask for help on assignments they have not accomplished, refuses to communicate with the group overall, or stops showing up to group meetings, as a group we will have a conversation with the Professor on how to move forward.


## Conflict Recognition & Resolution

* Recognize and openly acknowledge disagreements when they occur.
* When our opinions differ from time to time, especially as team members get to know one another and begin working together, we will resort to any data from either side and then utilize a voting system on the subject at hand.
* Conflicts of interest arise from ill-structured project roles and so we will do our best to stick to those roles. We would like to ideally have each memeber of our team volunteering for their own responsibilites and we will try address who will be covering what parts of the project in our weekly meetings.
* As a group we will be conscious of whos doing what so that no one person is assigned too much.
* If any conflicts arise during the semester within the team, we will try to resolve them as team first but will decide to include the instructor if conflict escalates.
