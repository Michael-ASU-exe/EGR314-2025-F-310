# Our Mission Statement
Our mission is to design and prototype innovative embedded systems that enhance wildfire prevention, detection, and response. By integrating advanced sensing, microcontroller, and IoT technologies into UAV platforms and ground-based weather stations, we aim to deliver reliable, real-time data that empowers firefighting agencies, protects local communities, and supports environmental stewardship. Through scalable, resilient, and stakeholder-focused solutions, our team is committed to shifting wildfire management from reactive firefighting to proactive risk prevention.

## Team Charter

* Sell 10 units in our first year.
    * Focusing in on the Tonto National forest we believe we can convinve ten campgrounds to invest in our product in the first year. 
* Take four months to go from opportunity identification to shipping our first units.
    * One base unit is a 10 ft tower with thermal and IR sensors, a motor for scanning 360°, and an ESP32 + server network.
* Reliable 360° sensor coverage with minimal false positives.
    * With a budget of $300, Acheiving this will be pivotal in our success. 
* Real-time communication to a local server accessible by campground employees.
    * Will be a great selling point for our product in todays world. 
* A functional prototype demonstrating fire hazard detection at a test site.
    * Getting a prototype running will make selling 10 units, that much easier. 

## Team Goals

* Early detection & prevention
    - Provide campground employees with real-time alerts of thermal anomalies to address potential fire hazards before ignition.
* Human-Centered Design
    - Embrace the “human element” by ensuring that the system supports staff decision-making rather than replacing it.

* Scalability & Adaptability
    - Create a modular tower system that can be deployed at multiple campsites, with hardware and software that adapt to different terrains and conditions.

* Technical Innovation

    - Integrate ESP32-based communications, a motorized IR sensor array, and thermal cameras into a robust, 10 ft tower design that is reliable in harsh outdoor environments.

* Stakeholder Impact

    - Deliver value to multiple stakeholders:

        * Campground Staff: actionable data to keep campers safe.

        * Campers/Communities: improved safety and peace of mind.

        * Environmental Agencies: a proactive, low-impact solution for wildfire prevention.
