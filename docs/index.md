# Our Mission Statement
Our mission is to create a device that uses infrared technology to spot hot spots from abandoned campfires and alert the forest service, helping stop wildfires before they spread.
## Team Charter

* Sell 10 units in our first year.
    * Focusing in on the Tonto National forest we believe we can convince ten campgrounds to invest in our product in the first year. 
* Take four months to go from opportunity identification to shipping our first units.
    * One base unit is a 10 ft tower with thermal and IR sensors, a motor for scanning 360°, and an ESP32 + server network.
* Reliable 360° sensor coverage with minimal false positives.
    * With a budget of $300, Acheiving this will be pivotal in our success. 
* Real-time communication to a local server accessible by campground employees.
    * Will be a great selling point for our product in todays world. 
* A functional prototype demonstrating fire hazard detection at a test site.
    * Getting a prototype running will make selling 10 units, that much easier.
