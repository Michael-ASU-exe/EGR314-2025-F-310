## Team Goals

* Early detection & prevention
    - Provide campground employees with real-time alerts of thermal anomalies to address potential fire hazards before ignition.
* Human-Centered Design
    - Embrace the “human element” by ensuring that the system supports staff decision-making rather than replacing it.

* Scalability & Adaptability
    - Create a modular tower system that can be deployed at multiple campsites, with hardware and software that adapt to different terrains and conditions.

* Technical Innovation

    - Integrate ESP32-based communications, a motorized IR sensor array, and thermal cameras into a robust, 10 ft tower design that is reliable in harsh outdoor environments.

* Stakeholder Impact

    - Deliver value to multiple stakeholders:

        * Campground Staff: actionable data to keep campers safe.

        * Campers/Communities: improved safety and peace of mind.

        * Environmental Agencies: a proactive, low-impact solution for wildfire prevention.

### Communication Procedures

We will communicate throughout the week via text or discord and will hold weekly meetings to update ourselves on where we all are on the parts we are working on. If a question comes up on a specific issue, an email or phone call could be necessary.

## Team Coordination & Accountability

* Ensure that assignments are submitted before deadlines and each team member has "signed off" on each submitted assignment
* Ensure that each team member has the knowledge and skill required for each assignment, and if that is not the case, we will adapt.
* Ensure that feedback from your design review is distributed to and acted on by every member of the team.
* When it comes to contributions missed on assignments, we will expect some type of explanation from that team member and ask for some responsibility on their end on how to rectify the situation.
* We will not force team members into assignments but we do assume that each member will volunteer when needed. 
* We expect team members to ask for help if they have run into work that they can't seem to accomplish.
* If a team member refuses to ask for help on assignments they have not accomplished, refuses to communicate with the group overall, or stops showing up to group meetings, as a group we will have a conversation with the Professor on how to move forward.


## Conflict Recognition & Resolution

* Recognize and openly acknowledge disagreements when they occur.
* When our opinions differ from time to time, especially as team members get to know one another and begin working together, we will resort to data from both sides and then utilize a voting system on the subject at hand.
* Conflicts of interest arise from ill-structured project roles, so we will do our best to stick to those roles. We would ideally like each member of our team to volunteer for their own responsibilities, and we will address who will be covering what parts of the project in our weekly meetings.
* As a group we will be conscious of whos doing what so that no one person is assigned too much.
* If any conflicts arise during the semester within the team, we will try to resolve them as team first, but will involve the instructor if conflict escalates.
