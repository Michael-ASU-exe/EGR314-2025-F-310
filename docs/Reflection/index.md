## <strong>4-Layered Board</strong>

* By building our PCB with four layers, we were able to minimize noise to our sensors, as well as allow us to save space and build a more compact board. This also helped us expand our knowledge of PCB stacks, and will hopefully help us in our future PCB-designing endeavors.

## <strong>Coding Issues</strong>

* We had last-minute troubles sending information to our ESP32, and we were unable to fix it in time for the showcase. This was somewhat out of our hands, however if we had more time, we may have been able to swap out the component and get our PCB working as intended.

## <strong>Budget Constraints</strong>

* We were able to get out thermal camera working, however due to budget constraints, we had to choose a camera that lagged and had limited range.
* If we had a larger budget, we technically could have given a slightly stronger demonstration of our product, although it wasn't necessary.
